#+title: Jupyter Notebook Theme
#+author: Mir Behroz Noor


*** Jupyter Notebook Configuration
In GNU/Linux, it is =$HOME/.jupyter/custom/=
**** From Terminal:
*Note:* if you are using virtual environment, activate your env (Conda or Pyenv) first then run this command:
#+begin_src shell
  jupyter --config-dir
#+end_src
**** Find the =Custom= folder
*Note:* Any file or folder name starting with "." indicates that it is a hidden file or folder.

In =.jupyter= folder, if there is no folder, create one manually or through terminal.
#+begin_src shell
cd ~/.jupyter/
mkdir -p custom
#+end_src

**** In =Custom= folder
#+begin_src shell
  git clone https://github.com/mirbehroznoor/jupyter-notebook-theme
#+end_src
*<OR>*

**** Manually Copy files
Copy the two .css files into =.jupyter/custom/=
#+begin_src
custom.css
highlight.css
#+end_src

*Refresh or Restart Jupyter-Notebook and Enjoy your new Theme*
*Keep Experimenting, there is no *One Size Fits All* theme :)
